# Scan pipeline

End-to-end flow from user sign-in to rendered account cards.

## Overview

The app answers one question: **what ATProto tools, feeds, and labelers has this user actually used, and how can they support those projects?**

Everything is account-centric. A card represents an **ATProto account** (identified by DID), and feeds, labelers, and tools are **capabilities** that account provides. The only entity type that gets a distinct visual treatment is a **tool** — an NSID-linked service with a lexicon. Everything else (follows, feed publishers, labelers) renders as a standard blue account card.

### Two entry paths

| Path | Trigger | Implementation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Full scan** | Sign-in, refresh | `scanStreaming()` — 4-phase pipeline, streams all entries |
| **Single entry** | Endorse-add, dep modal | `resolveEntry()` — full vertical for one URI |

Both produce the same `StewardEntry` shape. The full scan discovers accounts from the user's relationships; the single-entry path resolves one URI on demand.

### Pipeline phases

```
Phase 1: GATHER         Discover every account the user has a relationship with
Phase 2: ENRICH         Resolve funding info (fund.at, manual catalog, profiles)
Phase 3: CAPABILITIES   Attach feed/labeler details to enriched accounts
Phase 4: DEPENDENCIES   Resolve referenced entries for drill-down modal
```

## Phase 1: Gather accounts

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/account-gather.ts`

Collects every DID the user has a relationship with. No fund.at lookups — just discovery.

### Sources

| Source | How | Tag assigned |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Repo collections | NSIDs + `createdWith` + `$type` → resolver catalog → steward URI → DNS → DID | `tool` |
| Follows | `app.bsky.graph.getFollows` (paginated, ALL follows) | `follow` |
| Feed subscriptions | `getPreferences` → saved feed URIs → extract creator DID | *(none — held for Phase 3)* |
| Labeler subscriptions | `getPreferences` → labeler DIDs | *(none — held for Phase 3)* |
| Self-reported | User-provided handles/DIDs from "Endorse" input | `tool` |

Feed and labeler DIDs are registered with `ensureAccount()` — this reserves the DID slot in the accounts map **without assigning a tag**. Tags for these are derived from confirmed capability data in Phase 3. This prevents feeds from appearing as standalone cards before we know they're real capabilities.

### Output

```typescript
type GatherResult = {
  did: string
  handle?: string
  pdsUrl?: string
  accounts: Map<string, AccountStub>      // DID → stub with tags + hostnames
  unresolvedServices: UnresolvedService[]  // hostnames that didn't resolve to a DID
  warnings: ScanWarning[]
  feedUris: string[]                       // AT URIs for Phase 3
  labelerDids: string[]                    // DIDs for Phase 3
}
```

An `AccountStub` accumulates tags from multiple sources. If the same DID appears as a tool AND a follow AND a feed creator, it gets all three tags on one stub.

### Unresolved services

When a steward URI (hostname) doesn't resolve to a DID via DNS, it becomes an `UnresolvedService`. These are still shown as "discover" cards — the user relies on the service, we just can't identify the ATProto account behind it.

### Steward URI resolution

Observed keys (NSIDs, URLs, `$type` values) pass through `resolveStewardUri()` from `src/lib/catalog.ts`:

1. Check `resolver-catalog.json` overrides (longest prefix match)
2. If starts with `did:` → return as-is
3. If contains `://` → extract hostname
4. If 3+ dot segments → NSID; infer hostname from first two segments
5. If 1-2 dot segments → already a hostname; normalize and return

## Phase 2: Enrich accounts

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/account-enrich.ts`

For each account, resolves funding info by trying **every key type**. This is where the hostname-vs-DID mismatch is handled — we try all keys in one place.

### Resolution order

For each `AccountStub`:

1. **Batch profile resolution** — `app.bsky.actor.getProfiles` for all DIDs (batches of 25). Returns handle, displayName, description, avatar.
2. **fund.at records** — `fetchFundAtForStewardDid(did)` from the steward's PDS
3. **Manual catalog by DID** — `lookupManualStewardRecord(did)`
4. **Manual catalog by hostname** — `lookupManualStewardRecord(hostname)` for each associated hostname
5. **Manual catalog by handle** — `lookupManualStewardRecord(handle)`
6. **Fallback** — `source: 'unknown'`

### URI and displayName selection

- `uri`: hostname preferred (readable), then handle, then DID
- `displayName`: profile name preferred (non-DID), then hostname, then handle, then DID

### Emission gating

Phase 2 only emits entries that have at least one tag (`tags.length > 0`). Accounts that were registered with `ensureAccount()` in Phase 1 (feed/labeler-only accounts) have no tags yet and are **held** — they won't appear as cards until Phase 3 confirms their capabilities and adds tags.

### Output

One `StewardEntry` per account, plus entries for unresolved services.

## Phase 3: Attach capabilities

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/capability-scan.ts`

Fetches display info for feeds and labelers, then attaches them as `Capability` objects on the account's entry. Also adds `feed`/`labeler` tags and re-emits entries so the client receives updated cards.

### Feeds

`app.bsky.feed.getFeedGenerators(feedUris)` returns per-feed info (batched, max 25 per request):
- `displayName` — the feed's name (e.g., "Discover")
- `creator.did` — matched to an existing entry
- `uri` — AT URI, parsed for rkey
- `landingPage` — constructed as `https://bsky.app/profile/{handle}/feed/{rkey}`

Multiple feeds by the same creator become multiple capabilities on one card. Phase 3 also back-fills handle, displayName, and landingPage onto entries from API responses if the Phase 2 profile fetch returned incomplete data.

### Labelers

`app.bsky.labeler.getServices(dids)` returns labeler info:
- `creator.displayName` — the labeler name
- `landingPage` — Bluesky profile link

### Capability type

```typescript
type Capability = {
  type: 'feed' | 'labeler'
  name: string
  description?: string
  uri?: string
  landingPage?: string
}
```

## Phase 4: Resolve dependencies

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/dep-resolve.ts`

For entries with `dependencies[]`, looks up each dependency URI in the manual catalog. These "referenced entries" power the dependency drill-down modal — they're not shown as primary cards. Resolution is multi-level (breadth-first queue) so nested dependency chains are fully resolved.

## Orchestration

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/scan-stream.ts`

`scanStreaming()` runs all four phases and emits `ScanStreamEvent` objects for the client to consume progressively:

1. Endorsements → `endorsed` event with the user's endorsed URIs
2. Phase 1 → `status` events during discovery, `meta` event with user info, `warning` events
3. Phase 2 → `entry` events as each account is enriched (gated: only entries with tags)
4. Phase 3 → updated `entry` events with capabilities attached (first emission for feed/labeler-only accounts)
5. Phase 4 → `referenced` events for dependency entries
6. PDS host funding → `pds-host` event
7. `done` event

### Client-side merging

The client (`GiveClient.tsx`) uses `EntryIndex` from `steward-merge.ts` to deduplicate entries by DID as they stream in. When Phase 3 re-emits entries with capabilities, the merge unions tags and capabilities correctly.

## Single-entry resolution

**File:** `src/lib/pipeline/entry-resolve.ts`
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/entry?uri=<handle-or-did-or-hostname>`

Runs the full pipeline vertically for a single entity. Used for:
- **Endorse-add** — user endorses an account by handle; we fetch full data without rescanning
- **Dependency modal** — drilling into a dependency loads its complete entry

### Stages

```
Input: handle, DID, or hostname
  │
  ▼
1. RESOLVE IDENTITY
   • handle → resolveHandle → DID
   • hostname → DNS _atproto → DID
   • Fetch profile: avatar, displayName, description, handle
  │
  ▼
2. FUNDING & CATALOG
   • fetchFundAtForStewardDid(did) → contributeUrl, dependencies
   • lookupManualStewardRecord → contributeUrl, deps
   • Merge: fund.at wins, union deps
  │
  ▼
3. CAPABILITIES
   • listRecords(app.bsky.feed.generator) → discover ALL feeds the DID publishes
   • getFeedGenerators(uris) → feed display names, descriptions, landing pages
   • getServices([did]) → labeler status
   • Attach as Capability[], add feed/labeler tags
  │
  ▼
4. DEPENDENCIES
   • resolveDependencies([entry]) → referenced entries (multi-level, catalog-only)
  │
  ▼
Output: { entry: StewardEntry, referenced: StewardEntry[] }
```

Stage 3 discovers capabilities by listing the DID's own repo for feed generator records, rather than relying on the user's subscription list. This finds *all* feeds the account publishes.

## Rendering

### Card types

There are two card types, determined by the `cardType()` function:

| Type | Condition | Style | Title links to |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `tool` | Has `tool` tag | Warm left border, support accent | Website/hostname |
| `account` | Everything else | Blue left border, network accent | Bluesky profile |
| `discover` | `source === 'unknown'`, no capabilities | Amber dashed border | Website |

Only the `tool` tag affects card type. Feeds, labelers, and follows all render as blue account cards — their feeds/labelers appear in the "Provides" capabilities section.

### Card modes

Cards render in two modes:

- **Compact** (`<li>`) — used in the main give list. Shows ProfileAvatar, name, handle, tags, Fund/Endorse action buttons. Includes CapabilitiesSection and DependenciesSection below the row.
- **Article** (`<article>`) — full card with CardIconSlot (avatar with droplet badge overlay), name, handle, tags, EndorseButton pill, description, capabilities, dependencies.

          Description text
          ┌ Provides ──────────────┐
          │ 📰 Feed Name           │

          │ [avatar] dep-name    → │
          └────────────────────────┘
```

### Card anatomy (article mode)

```
[CardIconSlot]  Title  @handle  tag  tag  [Endorse pill]
                Description text
                ┌ Provides ──────────────┐
                │ 📰 Feed Name           │
                └────────────────────────┘
                ┌ Depends on ────────────┐
                │ [avatar] dep-name    → │
                └────────────────────────┘
```

### My Stack

Endorsed entries appear in the "My Stack" section at the top of the give page. Users can endorse entries from the main list or add new ones via the handle autocomplete. Endorsements are `fund.at.endorse` records — public, protocol-level signals of trust.

The hover state on endorsed buttons swaps to "Remove" with a red color shift to indicate the action.

### Filtering

Filter pills (Tools, Feeds, Labelers, Network) filter by tag. Since an account can have multiple tags, the same card may appear in multiple filtered views.

### Visibility rules

- Tools, labelers, feeds: always visible
- Follows: only visible if they have a `contributeUrl`

## Lexicon schemas

- `fund.at.contribute` — funding page URL (singleton, rkey `self`)
- `fund.at.dependency` — upstream dependency entries (rkey = URI)
- `fund.at.endorse` — endorsement entries (rkey = endorsed URI)

See the in-app lexicon page (`/lexicon`) for full schema documentation.
